total_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all components in the LSST
  system - mirrors, lenses, filter, detector, and the zenith atmos_std.dat atmosphere.

All curves are in nanometers, with throughput represented by a number between 0 and 1.

In order to maintain compatibility with ImSim simulations, files have been copied from

/global/cfs/cdirs/descssim/imSim/lsst/data/throughputs/baseline/total_*.dat

at NERSC. In the future, a better system for maintaining compatibility will be added.
