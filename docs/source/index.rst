Welcome to the lsstdesc_diffsky documentation
=============================================

lsstdesc-diffsky is a python library providing 
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`__ kernels used to predict the SEDs 
of a population of galaxies 
with `diffmah <https://diffmah.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
`diffstar <https://diffstar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, 
`dsps <https://dsps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. 
lsstdesc-diffsky uses the publicly available 
`diffsky <https://github.com/ArgonneCPAC/diffsky/>`__ library to make mock galaxy 
catalogs that have been tailored for LSST DESC data and analyses.
The source code is publicly available 
`on GitHub <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/lsstdesc-diffsky/>`__.
