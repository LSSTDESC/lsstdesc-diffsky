The notebooks below provide worked examples of some common calculations on diffsky mocks.


Roman/Rubin 2023 Demo Notebooks
===============================
The code demonstrated in the notebooks in this section pertains specifically to the 
``roman_rubin_2023`` mocks. These mocks were generated with particular versions of 
evolving code bases, and so you will need to make sure to install the versions of 
the Diff+ codes that are appropriate for the ``roman_rubin_2023`` mock:

* lsstdesc_diffsky==v1.0.0
* dsps==v0.3.5
* diffstar==v0.2.2
